=========================================================================

##by Vinicius

This repository contains code of Getting and Cleaning Data course project, as part of Coursera Data Science Specialization

### Goals
Main goals are getting data from UCI ML Repository and then, apply techniques to transform raw data into tidy data. Also, it is expected to write markdowns explaining data context. 

Reference: [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Steps (Course project requirements)
1. Read "Human activity recognition using smartphones" data
2. Extract just mean and std. deviation related variables
3. Rename activity numbers to activity factors.
4. Rename columns that matters for analysis
5. Create a new tidy data from step 4
